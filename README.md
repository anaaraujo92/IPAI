# IPAI Project Description
**Introduction:**
The IPAI project involves modelling and building a data warehouse that incorporates data over a period of time, and that is useful in decision-making scenarios. To this end, open data sources must be researched and consulted, taking into account a business process to be chosen by the working groups themselves.
\
The Theme project chosen was about Natural Disasters and their relation with Tourism, Agriculture, Countries Development and Unemployment.
\
\
**Objectives**

1. *Stage 1: Data Analysis*
 This stage consists of identifying the relevant data sources for a business process chosen by the group. The data was analyzed and the links between data 
from different sources are shown in a diagram. The objectives achieved in this stage were the following:
 
 - Identification the data sources used; -
 - Analisation of values and errors in the data fields of each source; 
 - Drawing a diagram with links between data sources; 
 - Description of the  business process to take advantage of data; 
 - Definition of three analytical questions for the business process. 

\
2. *Stage 2: Dimensional Modeling*
 In this stage, the elements gathered in the previous report were improved. However, here the emphasis is on creating a multidimensional model, suitable for a data warehouse. The objectives of this stage achieved are:

 - Problems fixed that were detected in the previous stage;
 - Declaration the grain and type of the fact table;
 - Model business dimensions, including data hierarchies;
 - Identification numerical measurements in the fact table;
 - Drawing of  the data warehouse star diagram.

\
3. *Stage 3: ETL system and reports*
This stage allowed improvements to the work carried out previously, but the essence was in the development of the ETL system and the production of analytical reports to answer the questions identified in stage 1. To do so, it was necessary to implement automatisms for extracting data from repositories, transforming them into the data staging area, and loading the data treated for the data presentation area. Therefore, the objectives to be achieved were:

-Problems fixed that detected in the previous stage;
-Development and testing the programs that make up the ETL system;
-Description of responsibilities, inputs, and outputs of each program/process;
-Drawing diagram with data flows and ETL system programs;
-Showing dimensions and fact table of the implemented data cube;
-Production of annotated reports that answer the analytical questions.
